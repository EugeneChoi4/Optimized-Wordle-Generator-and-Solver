**Protocol for when things go wrong:**

Our main mode of communication will be via Facebook Messenger. We expect a timely reply within the span of a day, though ideally, no one&#39;s concerns will go unanswered by the entire group for more than a few hours. If there are any issues in the group, such as a group member not contributing their assigned tasks, we will first notify the member of our concerns. If the issues persist and the member does not make any changes to their behavior, we will go to one of the professors about our concerns.

**&quot;What are the ideal qualities of a teammate?&quot;**

A teammate should ideally have good communication about their concerns, tasks, and ideas. They should be willing to take constructive criticism if required, and not actively seek to cause any conflicts within the team. A teammate will respect the ideas and decisions of all other teammates and never be hostile towards others.

**&quot;What are the ideal qualities of a programmer?&quot;**

An ideal programmer should write readable code that can be understood by other group members. They should also provide documentation on any functions that they create (including helper functions). They should also respect code that is written by other members, and create consistent code.
